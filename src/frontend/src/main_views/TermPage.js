        <h2>Pricing Policy</h2>

        The amount due for an appointment is directly paid by the Tutee to the Tutor.
        Shareyourwiz is charging a 10% fee of the total amount to the Tutor to cover the cost of operation. On top of our fee,
        Stripe (our payment partner <Link href='https://stripe.com/pricing' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stripe.com/pricing</Link>)
        charges an additional fee of 2.9% + 30¢ (+1% for non-US card).<br /><br />

        Example: Let's assume that Mark (the Tutee) owns $100 to Julie (the Tutor) for a tutoring session:<br />
        - Mark pays $100<br />
        - Shareyourwiz charges a fee of $100 x 10% = $10<br />
        - Stripe charges a fee of $100 x 2.9% + 30¢ = $3.20<br />
        - Julie is finally paid $100 - $10 - $3.20 = $86.80<br /><br />

        To calculate the total amount due for the appointment, we simply need to look at the duration of the appointment
        and the hourly fees of the Tutor. The cost is calculated as:<br /><br />

        the duration in minutes x the Tutor's hourly fees / the number of minutes in 1 hour (= 60 min)<br /><br />

        with a minimum amount charged of $1.<br /><br />

        Example: Let's assume that Julie's hourly fees are $30 and that she set up a 40 min appoinment.<br />
        - The cost for this appointment will be ($30 / 60 min) x 40 min = $20<br /><br />

        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>

        When a Tutee books an Appointment with a Tutor, there can be different conditions in which the Appointment is cancelled:<br />
        <ul>
            <li> As long as the Tutor did not confirm the Appointment, both the Tutor and the Tutee can cancel the Appointment at no charge</li>

            <li>After the Tutor confirms the Appointment, the Tutor can cancel the appointment at any time before the time of the appointment.
                When the appointment is cancelled, the full amount of the transaction is refunded minus a transaction fee. Since, the refund is initiated by the
                Tutor, the Tutor incurs a balance equal to the transaction fee and the Tutee incurs a credit equal to the transaction fee. Those balance and
                credit will be applied in future transactions. The transaction fees are 2.9% + 30¢ (+1% for non-US card)
            </li>

            <li>As soon as the Tutor confirms the Appointment, the Tutee <b>cannot</b> cancel the Appointment and no refund can be initiated
                by the Tutee from the Shareyourwiz platform (this will change in the future). The Tutee can however agree with the Tutor for the
                Tutor to refund the payment from his/her end. If the Tutor cancels the Appointment after confirming and refunds the payment, a transaction
                balance is applied to the Tutor's account (this will change in the future) and a credit is applied to the Tutee's account. The transaction fees
                are 2.9% + 30¢ (+1% for non-US card)</li>

            <li>Example: Let's assume that Mark (the Tutee) booked a tutoring session with Julie (the Tutor) for $100:<br />
                - Julie did not yet confirm and Mark cancels the Appointment: no charge is applied and Mark recovers the full payment amount.
                - Julie confimed but she realized later that she cannot be available during that time: in that situation, transactions fees apply.
                The transaction fee is $100 x 2.9% + 30¢ = $3.20. Mark is refunded $100 - $3.20 = $96.80 and receives a credit of $3.20 to be applied
                anytime on the platform. Julie will receive no payment and is applied a balance of $3.20 that will be collected as fees from the next payment.
            </li>
        </ul><br />
